/**
 * 0: Data types are ways of categorizing information to create taxonomies of behavior / use. They correspond to prototype objects 
 * that have specific prototype methods attached to them that facilitate manipulation of the given data. They are often divided 
 * between simple and complex types.
 * 
 * 1: A number data type can be positive or negative. Can be an integer or a float (decimal). Numbers can only be of a certain 
 * size before they must be represented by approximation or special notation. A simple data type.
 * 
 * 2: A series of alphabetic, numeric, or symbolic characters. Strings are denoted through being surrounded by either single 
 * or double quotes. Numeric characters can't be mathematically operated without conversion to number datat type. Strings have
 * their own specific methods of manipulation. Strings are immutable, string methods create newstrings based on the current string
 *  Each character of a string corresponds to a numeric index starting with 0. A simple data type.
 * 
 * 3: Booleans provide a binary system of analysis--true or false. usually used to handle conditional logic. A simple data type.
 * 
 * 4: Arrays are a complex data type. They are comprised of an indexed series of elements, beginning at 0. Arrays are denoted 
 * by square brackets, with elements divided by commas. Arrays can homogenous or heterogenous in terms of composition, but are 
 * primarily homogenous (comprised of one datat type). Arrays can contain both simple and / or complex data types, including more
 * arrays. An array of arrays is called a matrix.
 * 
 * 5: An object is another complex data type, but rather than an indexed list it is comprised of properties--pairs wherein a descriptive
 *  key string corresponds to a value of any type. Objects can have both different data types and functions (methods) as properties 
 * of it. 
 * 
 * 6: A function is itself a data type/
